QLinkSpan

QLinkSpan: Is it possible to change the link to exciting?

The standard QLinkButton and QButton controls don't allow the user to change links with desired appearances. Using QLinkSpan is easy and offers more opportunities. CSS is great friend. There is no need to code it in a complicated way to get these buttons...

Example: http://cl.ly/image/2K1G0J3i0h2s

Attention! Grouping buttons to work, it must be removed slashes /includes/qcubed/controls/QControl.class.php line 29: protected $blnUseWrapper = false;

QLinkSpan template files are heavily cropped! I wrote the class, in accordance http://www.display-inline.fr/demo/developr/template/buttons.html. 
Se is a very good template! I am very pleased with it. This class is recommended for use to buy there: http://themeforest.net/item/developr-fully-responsive-admin-skin/2085628?ref=displayinline.
