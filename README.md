QLinkSpan: Is it possible to change the link to exciting?

The standard QLinkButton and QButton controls don't allow the user to change links with desired appearances. Using QLinkSpan is easy and offers more opportunities. CSS is great friend. There is no need to code it in a complicated way to get these buttons...

Attention! Grouping buttons to work, it must be removed slashes /includes/qcubed/controls/QControl.class.php line 29: protected $blnUseWrapper = false;
